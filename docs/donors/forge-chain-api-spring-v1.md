# Forge chain API Spring v1 donor baseline

## Baseline

- Repository: `https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring`
- Commit: `e6a99f68b67abc4d89fe716755b2e1394a4991f7`
- License: MIT
- Machine-readable manifest: `tests/chain_api/spring_api_manifest.json`
- Gate: `tests/chain_api/check_spring_api_manifest.py`

The manifest pins the complete HTTP endpoint registrations from:

- `plugins/chain_api_plugin/chain_api_plugin.cpp`
- `plugins/producer_api_plugin/producer_api_plugin.cpp`

It also pins the DTO and behavior source files used by those registrations. The
checker compares the endpoint names as exact sets: 33 chain endpoints and 21
producer endpoints. Counts alone are not acceptance evidence.

## Accepted patterns

- Spring registration, DTO, and behavior ownership are recorded separately.
- Runtime-conditional registrations retain their exact enablement predicate.
- Forge mappings may be direct, server projections, client projections, or the
  local transaction-id utility when the distinction is explicit.
- A donor test or fixture is named when one exists at the pinned commit.
- `donor_evidence.status=none` is allowed only with an explicit reason.
- Spine acceptance is endpoint-specific and uses a stable evidence id.
- One endpoint may name multiple cases from the same source when its contract
  requires distinct lifecycle paths, as for `send_transaction2` finality and
  canonical fork-out retry behavior.

## Rejected patterns

- Inferring completeness from endpoint counts.
- Treating a Forge method declaration as proof that Spine implements it.
- Treating a domain/unit test as endpoint acceptance without exercising the
  endpoint contract.
- Inventing a passing test or replacing missing evidence with an empty response.
- Editing the pinned Spring donor corpus.

## Fail-closed status

All 54 endpoint entries currently have `spine_acceptance.status=present`; no
pending acceptance evidence remains. That declaration is not itself a passing
gate. Product acceptance requires Spine CI to run every referenced case from a
clean checkout against an exact released Forge tag. Dirty worktrees are not
reproducible acceptance evidence.

The checker can be run by Spine CI with both repositories to verify that every
referenced source file exists and contains each exact Boost.Test case:

```sh
python3 tests/chain_api/check_spring_api_manifest.py FORGE_ROOT SPINE_ROOT
```

The pre-merge workflow is started manually by pushing a lightweight acceptance
tag with the reviewed Forge revision and the performance mode:

```text
ci/chain-audited-api/<forge-sha>/<1m|10m>
```

The workflow rejects a tag that does not point to its declared full Forge SHA,
and leaves a content-addressed audit trail for the Forge acceptance run. Once
the workflow is available on the default branch, `workflow_dispatch` remains
available with the same performance input.

Forge owns the transport-neutral API contracts, authenticated state, verifier,
donor manifest, and package acceptance. Downstream product integration is not a
Forge release dependency: Spine verifies the manifest mapping and end-to-end
behavior in its own CI against an exact released Forge tag. Forge therefore
does not require access credentials for the private Spine repository.

Forge-local CTest uses the explicit manifest-only mode. It validates the
manifest and Forge-local transaction-id fixture, reports Spine acceptance as
`NOT_RUN`, and exits with code 125 so CTest records the gate as skipped rather
than passed:

```sh
python3 tests/chain_api/check_spring_api_manifest.py FORGE_ROOT --manifest-only
```

Scheduled protocol-feature admission is evidenced at the producer owner in
`producer_passes_admin_policy_and_scheduled_features_to_controller_begin`. Its
downstream same-block activation and replay behavior is independently covered
in Spine by
`produced_feature_extension_activates_in_same_block_and_subjective_policy_is_not_replayed`.

The pinned donor has no endpoint-specific `send_transaction2` test or fixture
identified by this audit. Its manifest entry therefore records explicit donor
evidence absence while retaining the registration, DTO, and behavior sources.
