# forge_net_p2p

`forge_net_p2p` is the peer-to-peer layer above transport sessions: peer identities,
sessions, protocol stream negotiation, peer exchange, relay reservations,
reachability probes, hole punching, path scoring, discovery protocol machinery
and GossipSub/pubsub.

API status: `forge.net.p2p.resource_manager` is Preview while P2P production
hardening replaces manual counters with move-only reservations. The Stage 3
migration intentionally removes `try_acquire_*`/`release_*`; callers retain the
returned reservation for the complete operation lifetime instead. Other public
P2P contracts remain Stable unless their owning section explicitly says
otherwise.

## Current Support State

This library contains substantial libp2p-compatible protocol substrate, but it
is not yet a complete autonomous production host. Direct QUIC and TCP/Yamux,
secure peer authentication, node-owned bootstrap, automatic Identify,
session/stream/dial admission and transport-backed queued-byte accounting are
on the normal node path. Managed topology now has one node-owned lifecycle for
bounded DHT, configured Rendezvous and Forge Peer Exchange discovery, while
`static_only` disables autonomous discovery and dialing. GossipSub has bounded
connected-peer mechanics and live interop fixtures, but its overall support
state remains `partial` until donor-consistent scoring is complete.

The following surfaces are not production claims yet:

- Kademlia now provides isolated Amino and product profiles, bounded node-owned
  k-buckets, autonomous routing refresh, durable validated values, owned
  provider registration and `/pk`/`/ipns` interoperability. Managed topology
  consumes peer-capable profiles without creating a second routing refresh;
- Rendezvous and the Forge-specific Peer Exchange feed the same bounded
  topology manager. Donor/live evidence remains classified separately in the
  inventory and must not be inferred from lifecycle activation alone;
- Ping sampling and AutoNAT are not yet inputs to the managed topology score;
- AutoRelay and DCUtR mechanics lack the complete verified discovery and
  reachability feed;
- GossipSub donor-consistent scoring and autonomous mesh selection remain incomplete;
  transport topology is owned by the managed topology service above.

The machine-readable support inventory is
[`p2p_feature_inventory.json`](../../../tests/libp2p_interop/p2p_feature_inventory.json).
It is the source inventory for the production-hardening program, not a record
of currently executed optional interop tests or a release-readiness verdict. A
`mapped` donor case names a compatibility fixture with declared Forge
coverage; it does not prove normal lifecycle activation or a passing current
donor run.

`discovery::policy` and `node::limits::discovery` remain Stable source
compatibility surfaces. Node construction normalizes non-default legacy values
into the single managed topology policy and rejects conflicting non-default
legacy and topology settings. `peer_store::apply_peer_exchange` likewise
remains the legacy capability-union mutator; received third-party Forge Peer
Exchange facts do not call it and remain capability-free until Identify.

## When To Use

- Nodes need to connect by peer identity, not just host/port.
- Application protocols need named streams such as `/example/1`.
- Direct transports should be tried first, with explicit relay/hole-punch
  fallback.
- Application/plugin composition needs a shared P2P transport owner; use
  `forge::plugins::p2p::node` as the lifecycle/config/route facade above this
  low-level engine.

## When Not To Use

- Do not put application message semantics or storage semantics here.
- Do not treat P2P as authorization. Peer identity is transport identity;
  application authority is owned by consumers.
- Do not put application receipt, durable queue, storage or authorization semantics
  into peer networking. DHT, rendezvous, AutoRelay and GossipSub mechanics
  belong in `forge_net_p2p`; application protocols decide what an operation means.

Dependencies: `forge_api_core`, `forge_asio`, `forge_net_transport`,
`forge_net_tcp`, `forge_net_quic`, `forge_net_yamux`, `forge_multiformats` and
Boost.Asio. The library has no database dependency; durable state is supplied
through the asynchronous `peer_store::persistence` and
`dht::record_store::persistence` ports.

Foundation compatibility modules below P2P live in `forge_multiformats`:
`forge.multiformats.varint`, `forge.multiformats.multicodec`,
`forge.multiformats.multihash`, `forge.multiformats.multibase` and
first-class multiaddr/address support.

## Production Network Direction

`forge_net_p2p` is the owner for production peer-network mechanics. The direction is
a clean C++23 libp2p-compatible implementation: FORGE public types stay
FORGE/Boost-style, while supported libp2p protocols must be wire-compatible with
go-libp2p and rust-libp2p.

Compatibility is not a direct libp2p dependency and not a Go/Rust runtime clone.
It means the same peer identity model, address encoding, protocol negotiation,
handshake, protocol IDs and message rules for protocols FORGE marks as supported.

The canonical block order and donor test rules live in
[`docs/network/quic-p2p.md`](../../../docs/network/quic-p2p.md). Keep this README
as a library overview; do not duplicate the block sequence here.

Current direction: P2P sits above first-class multiaddr, reusable
`forge_net_transport`, and reusable TCP/STCP/Yamux/QUIC layers. QUIC and
TCP+TLS/Noise+Yamux direct paths are wired through private direct profiles.
Future transports must plug into the same multiaddr and transport session
boundary, not fork P2P core.

The direct QUIC profile keeps a bounded, peer-scoped cache of opaque QUIC
`NEW_TOKEN` values only for authenticated expected peers. Its key includes the
expected peer identity and direct endpoint host kind/address/UDP port, never
ALPN or local port. Unknown-peer and insecure-test dials explicitly disable
this cache. Profile stop closes the cache before active dial cancellation, so a
late transport callback cannot repopulate it.

`forge_net_transport` is the stream/session substrate for `forge_net_p2p`; it is not an API
or RPC layer. API-over-stream serving lives in `forge.api.stream`, where QUIC/P2P
bindings share frame serve-loop logic without putting `forge::api` into
`forge_net_transport`.

Network-level behaviors that must not be pushed into plugins:

- relay-only/no-direct path support;
- independent maintenance scheduling for peer exchange, reachability, relay
  reservation renewal and discovery;
- peer discovery and relay discovery;
- protocol capability negotiation;
- network limits, backpressure, metrics and shutdown behavior.

Circuit Relay v2 reservations belong to authenticated peer sessions. Renewal
keeps the same reservation generation and active-circuit accounting; the final
session disconnect releases the reservation. Configured relay duration must be
positive and exactly representable in the whole seconds advertised on the wire.
Per-direction byte limits close the direction as soon as its final permitted
byte is forwarded.

`forge_net_p2p` remains free of application plugins, storage and authorization
policy. Application protocols own idempotency, acknowledgement and
permission checks above P2P.

GossipSub validation keeps `accept`, `reject` and `ignore` terminal while the
message remains in bounded history. `retry`, handler failure and local
validation backpressure are transient: the receiving heartbeat requests the
cached payload from its source peer after a capped exponential cooldown,
independently of ordinary `IHAVE` history. A message becomes terminally ignored
after the configured validation or request-attempt limit. Each heartbeat
applies a round-robin retry budget, and retry records are evicted with the
payload history, so unreachable peers and repeated transient failures cannot
create unbounded work or a second cache.

## Examples

### Start A Node

```cpp
#include <boost/asio/awaitable.hpp>

import forge.net.p2p.identity;
import forge.net.p2p.endpoint;
import forge.net.p2p.lifecycle;
import forge.net.p2p.node;

boost::asio::awaitable<void> start_node(forge::asio::runtime& runtime) {
   auto options = forge::net::p2p::node::options{
      .certificate_pem = certificate_pem,
      .private_key_pem = private_key_pem,
      .peer_state = {.persistence = persistence},
      .lifecycle = {
         .listen = {forge::net::p2p::parse_endpoint(
            "/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/9443/quic-v1")},
         .bootstrap = {forge::net::p2p::bootstrap_peer{
            .address = forge::net::p2p::parse_endpoint(bootstrap_endpoint)}},
      },
   };

   auto node = forge::net::p2p::node{runtime, options};
   const auto status = co_await node.async_start();
   if (status.degraded) {
      report_degraded_bootstrap(status);
   }
   co_await node.async_stop();
}
```

Production certificates must carry the signed libp2p identity extension. Peer
IDs are not derived from a bare certificate hash in production verification
paths.

Bootstrap endpoints should include `/p2p/<peer-id>` so the authenticated peer is
pinned before the dial. Peer-less legacy endpoints remain accepted: the node
learns and protects the peer only after transport authentication succeeds.

### Parse A libp2p QUIC Endpoint

`forge::net::p2p::endpoint` is FORGE-style public vocabulary. It accepts and emits the
libp2p address text format for compatibility, but callers do not need to model
their application API around the `multiaddr` term.

```cpp
import forge.net.p2p.endpoint;

auto endpoint = forge::net::p2p::parse_endpoint(
   "/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/4001/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooW...");

co_await node.async_listen(endpoint);

co_await node.async_listen(forge::net::p2p::parse_endpoint("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001"));
std::vector<forge::net::p2p::endpoint> advertised = node.local_endpoints();
```

QUIC and TCP+TLS/Noise+Yamux are currently registered direct transports. TCP
prefers libp2p TLS (`/tls/1.0.0`) and keeps Noise as fallback. `/ws` and `/wss`
multiaddrs are parseable but direct dial/listen returns typed unsupported until
a dedicated compatibility block wires a production transport. Future transports
must use the same private direct profile boundary.

The Noise transport treats the secured connection as a byte stream and segments
large Yamux writes into independently authenticated Noise records whose encrypted
length fits the protocol's 16-bit record header. The live TCP Noise matrix sends
a 192 KiB echo payload in both Forge/Go/Rust directions so record segmentation is
proved across donor implementations rather than inferred from raw Yamux tests.

`local_endpoints()` is the full canonical listen/advertise set and each endpoint
includes `/p2p/<local-peer>`. `local_endpoint()` remains a first-endpoint
compatibility convenience for older single-listen consumers.

### Peer And DHT Record Persistence

The low-level node requires `peer_store::persistence` outside explicit insecure
tests. The backend-neutral asynchronous contract provides paged hydration,
atomic mutation batches, bounded expiry pruning, flush and deterministic close.
Prune returns the exact peer and Rendezvous identities removed, so
the bounded operational directory applies the same deletion set even when the
durable store contains older records that were not hydrated.
The operational directory remains bounded and performs indexed point/candidate
queries without scanning durable history. Per-peer endpoint, protocol, relay and
total variable-byte limits prevent one remote peer from bypassing the global
peer and persistence-queue bounds. The endpoint and total variable-byte limits
also apply to each Rendezvous record, including records returned during
hydration, before any operational state is changed. DHT provider/value bounds
belong to the profile-scoped `dht::record_store` described below.

Identify address provenance is operational metadata used to replace each live
unsigned or certified snapshot without appending stale addresses. The existing
ObjectDB cache schema v2 separates peer/Rendezvous rows from profile-scoped DHT
value/provider rows while retaining one physical named store. Hydrated peer
endpoints conservatively re-enter as
learned cache facts and age through the existing peer-health/expiry policy;
the next verified Identify refresh establishes provenance for its live
snapshot.

Identify receive limits distinguish one length-delimited frame from the merged
multipart message. Defaults accept the Go libp2p profile of at most ten 8 KiB
parts while reserving the complete decode budget before reading. Partial
Identify Push follows Rust libp2p merge semantics: omitted scalar fields and
empty repeated fields preserve the previous verified facts. A valid signed
PeerRecord with an equal sequence is accepted as a refresh because Rust
sequences have second granularity; a lower sequence is rejected. Lifecycle
diagnostics expose the last non-cancellation bootstrap failure directly.

The official P2P plugin supplies the production ObjectDB adapter. Direct users
may implement the persistence port over their own lifecycle owner. The memory
implementation is deterministic but intended only for tests and explicit local
experiments.

Peer state and DHT records are intentionally separate operational domains even
when the official plugin stores them in one physical ObjectDB store. Each DHT
profile owns an isolated routing table, value/provider record store, query and
maintenance lifecycle. The Amino profile fixes `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0`, `k=20`,
`alpha=10`, `/pk` and `/ipns`; product validators/selectors require a distinct
product protocol ID. Queries initialize the shortlist from the local `k`
closest peers and use `alpha` only as the concurrent RPC bound.
Per-profile diagnostics expose whether autonomous maintenance is enabled, the
startup lookup and in-flight state, consecutive failures and the bounded delay
until the next attempt.

Custom value validators report deterministic record invalidity with
`exceptions::record_rejected`. Capacity, persistence, key resolution and other
operational failures must retain their original typed error so a GET quorum
cannot silently discard a locally valid record.
`record_store::async_put_received()` is the explicit network-ingress boundary:
it returns an empty result only for validator-origin record rejection. Durable
apply failures, including a backend exception carrying the same error code,
still propagate and mark persistence degraded. Direct application writes use
`async_put()` and never silently discard an invalid value.
Value retention is controlled independently by `value_record_ttl`; provider
identity, provider addresses and provider republishing retain their separate
TTL settings. All wire-derived lifetimes are positive and bounded by the DHT
`uint32` TTL representation before deadline arithmetic.

Amino keeps the donor-compatible 16 KiB outbound message limit and accepts the
larger bounded inbound messages used by Go/Rust implementations. Inbound peer
lists and endpoint lists are parsed into fixed local bounds instead of rejecting
an otherwise valid response solely because it contains more candidates than
Forge will retain.

`async_provide()` returns a move-only `provider_registration`. Its first
publication is acknowledged only after the local record is durable and the
requested remote quorum succeeds. The node renews that exact endpoint snapshot
with jitter while an owner remains; the last withdrawal removes local
ownership. Restart never resumes publication without a fresh product-owned
registration. Reaching the caller's quorum does not stop publication to the
remaining closest peers: the node attempts the complete `k`-bounded fanout and
reports success only when the requested quorum was reached.

Only an authenticated `ADD_PROVIDER` from the claimed provider creates durable
remote ownership. Providers returned by third-party `GET_PROVIDERS` responses
are bounded discovery results and are not assigned a fresh local TTL. Likewise,
`GET_VALUE` returns the remaining lifetime of a stored record rather than
replaying the TTL from the original request.

For a mutation requesting durable acknowledgement, persistence distinguishes a
failed commit from a commit whose subsequent durable flush could not be
confirmed. The latter is applied to operational state, marks the store degraded
and raises typed `durability_uncertain`; callers must not blindly retry the
logical operation as though it were known not to have committed.
The degraded state remains sticky across non-durable maintenance and is cleared
only by a later confirmed durable apply or explicit flush.
`node::diagnostics()` exposes the queue depth, sticky degraded state, failure
count and last persistence failure so operators do not have to infer durable
health from a transient call error.

Production ObjectDB hydration validates one raw row at a time. Each bounded
page is read through its own operation-scoped snapshot; no unbounded snapshot is
held across the complete hydration sequence. Per-record limits are checked
before conversion into operational peer or DHT state, so a malformed durable
row cannot force an unbounded hydration page into memory. Before live-record
capacity is enforced, DHT hydration removes expired durable rows in bounded
prune pages. `max_hydration_pages` bounds each startup phase; exhaustion
returns typed backpressure instead of holding the persistence gate forever, and
a later hydration attempt continues from the already committed cleanup. DHT
deadlines bound the remote wire exchanges. Once a provider or
Rendezvous record has been accepted for durable acknowledgement, its persistence
step remains owned and awaited by the caller instead of being abandoned after a
possibly committed transaction.
Rendezvous servers use `async_register_rendezvous()` so the configured per-peer
registration limit is checked under the persistence gate before a durable write.
Client discovery materializes the wire TTL into a local absolute expiry before
the accepted registration enters operational or durable peer state.

```cpp
auto node = forge::net::p2p::node{runtime, {
   .certificate_pem = certificate_pem,
   .private_key_pem = private_key_pem,
   .peer_state = {.persistence = persistence},
   .lifecycle = {
      .listen = {listen_endpoint},
      .bootstrap = {{.address = bootstrap_endpoint}},
   },
}};

auto status = co_await node.async_start();

auto test_store = forge::net::p2p::peer_store{
   {.persistence = forge::net::p2p::peer_store::make_memory_persistence()}};
```

### Register A Protocol

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

node.register_protocol_handler(forge::net::p2p::protocol_id{.value = "/example/1"},
                               [](forge::net::p2p::node::incoming_protocol_stream incoming)
   -> boost::asio::awaitable<void> {
   std::vector<std::uint8_t> frame = co_await incoming.stream.async_read_frame();
   co_await incoming.stream.async_write_frame(frame);
});
```

### Publish Typed APIs Above P2P

Application protocols that need request/response, typed errors and idempotent
operation receipts should expose an `forge_api_core` contract and mount it through the
P2P API binding or `forge::plugins::p2p::resolver`. P2P opens the stream and
enforces peer/path policy; API dispatch owns method calls and error projection;
the application handler owns authorization and durable state.

### Typed API Protocol Binding

`forge.api.p2p.binding` builds P2P API bindings on top of negotiated protocol streams.
The binding path uses `multistream-select` and the same direct, hole-punch and
relay path manager as ordinary P2P protocol streams; it must not reintroduce an
FORGE-only hello envelope into direct QUIC sessions. Once a protocol stream is
open, frame serving delegates to `forge.api.stream`; P2P keeps only P2P policy:
protocol id, known-peer checks and discovery scope.

### Connect And Open A Protocol Stream

This is the low-level engine path for custom transport owners and tests.
Application plugins should use `forge::plugins::p2p::node::api` instead of calling these
methods directly.

```cpp
boost::asio::awaitable<void> open_example_stream(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   forge::net::p2p::node::session_info session = co_await node.async_connect(remote_endpoint, {
      .expected_peer = expected_peer,
      .timeout = std::chrono::milliseconds{10'000},
   });

   forge::net::p2p::stream stream = co_await node.async_open_protocol_stream(
      session.remote_peer,
      forge::net::p2p::protocol_id{.value = "/example/1"});
   use_stream(std::move(stream));
}
```

### Learn Endpoints And Probe Reachability

```cpp
import forge.net.p2p.peer_store;

node.peers().learn_endpoint(
   remote_peer,
   forge::net::p2p::parse_endpoint("/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/9444/quic-v1"),
   {.bits = forge::net::p2p::capabilities::direct_quic | forge::net::p2p::capabilities::peer_exchange});

boost::asio::awaitable<void> update_reachability(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   forge::net::p2p::reachability::state reachability = co_await node.async_probe_reachability(observer_peer);
   if (reachability == forge::net::p2p::reachability::state::relay_only) {
      schedule_relay_setup(remote_peer);
   }
}
```

### Reserve Relay Explicitly

```cpp
boost::asio::awaitable<void> open_relayed_stream(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   forge::net::p2p::relay::reservation::info reservation = co_await node.async_reserve_relay(
      relay_peer,
      {.ttl = std::chrono::milliseconds{60'000}, .max_streams = 8});

   forge::net::p2p::stream relayed = co_await node.async_open_protocol_stream(
      remote_peer,
      forge::net::p2p::protocol_id{.value = "/example/1"},
      {.allow_relay = true, .relay_peer = reservation.relay_peer});
   use_stream(std::move(relayed));
}
```

### Stop Cleanly

```cpp
boost::asio::awaitable<void> stop_node(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   co_await node.async_stop();
}

void request_node_stop(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   node.stop();
}

boost::asio::awaitable<void> finish_node_stop(forge::net::p2p::node& node) {
   co_await node.async_stop();
}
```

`stop()` closes admission and listeners and starts disconnecting current
sessions without blocking the caller. It intentionally removes those sessions
from the active set before their transport teardown has finished.
`async_stop()` is the completion barrier: it always waits for the teardown
started by `stop()`, including STCP/Yamux read-loop cleanup.

## Security Notes

Production options require mTLS identity with a signed libp2p certificate
extension. `allow_insecure_test_mode` exists for tests and explicit local
experiments only; in that mode the node may use the in-memory peer store when no
persistence is provided. Peer mismatch, TLS verification failure, missing
identity extension and invalid envelopes are correctness failures.

The node parses its configured identity key once during construction and reuses
the immutable key material for TLS, Noise, PubSub, rendezvous and relay
signatures. Insecure QUIC-only test nodes may omit signing material until an
operation that requires a signature is used.

## Risks And Anti-Patterns

- Do not treat peer identity as application authorization. It proves transport
  identity, not permission to perform application actions.
- Do not silently fall back to relay for operations that require a direct-peer
  policy. Relay use must be explicit and visible to the caller.
- Do not put durable delivery, exactly-once semantics or storage guarantees in
  `forge_net_p2p`; protocols above P2P own those contracts.
- Do not implement application retry or durable delivery loops against raw
  `node` in application plugins. Use typed request/receipt APIs for synchronous
  operations and a focused higher-level service for durable asynchronous work.
- Do not define a new P2P-only API error payload. API protocols use
  `forge::api::core::error_payload` in `forge::api::core::frame` error responses.
- Do not let protocol handler exceptions disappear in detached tasks. Expected
  application failures should be typed exceptions and unexpected failures should
  be counted/diagnosed.
- Do not treat `.peer_policy(...)` or `.max_inflight_per_peer(...)` as cosmetic.
  Unknown peers and too many active API calls are rejected before application API
  handlers run.
- Do not make `forge.api.p2p.binding` responsible for peer discovery, relay or node
  lifecycle. It is only the API protocol binding artifact.
- Do not implement AutoNAT, AutoRelay, DHT, rendezvous or pubsub loops in an
  infrastructure plugin. Network mechanics belong in `forge_net_p2p`; plugins only
  configure and consume them.

## Typical Mistakes

- Do not pass plaintext secrets through protocol IDs or peer metadata.
- Do not register duplicate protocol handlers; the node rejects them.
- Do not use relay fallback silently for actions that require direct peer policy.

## Tests

`test_forge_quic_p2p` covers identity shape, codec rejection, direct protocol echo,
path manager fallback, connect/open timeouts, peer exchange, relay, reachability,
hole punching, DHT/rendezvous component behavior and production option
validation.
