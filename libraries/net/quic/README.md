# forge_net_quic

`forge_net_quic` owns the QUIC transport layer over ngtcp2, OpenSSL 3.0+ and Boost.Asio.
It exposes endpoints, security options, listeners, connectors, connections and
framed streams without defining application protocols.

## Transport Alignment Checkpoint

`forge_net_quic` is a native `forge_net_transport` session transport. The
`forge.net.quic.transport` module exposes:

- `quic::as_transport_stream(...)` and `quic::as_transport_session(...)` for
  adapting existing QUIC objects.
- `quic::make_session_connector(...)` and
  `quic::make_session_listener(...)` for direct `transport::session` usage.
- `quic::register_session(...)` for `transport::registry` integration.
- `quic::to_transport_limits(...)` and `quic::from_transport_limits(...)` for
  explicit limit mapping.

QUIC is already a multiplexed session transport. TCP and STCP remain
byte-stream transports; they become sessions only after a muxer such as Yamux.

## Endpoint Address Family

`quic::endpoint::family` constrains DNS resolution only. `any` maps a DNS host
to `transport::endpoint::host_kind::dns`; `ipv4` and `ipv6` map it to `dns4`
and `dns6`, respectively. A numeric IPv4 or IPv6 `endpoint::host` determines
its actual family regardless of this trailing field and round-trips as `ip4` or
`ip6`.

The QUIC transport connector validates `ip4` with `make_address_v4` and `ip6`
with `make_address_v6` before opening a socket. DNS host kinds are valid only
for connecting; listeners reject them.

## When To Use

- Need multiplexed, TLS-backed streams over UDP.
- Need pinned certificate fingerprints or mTLS-style checks at transport level.
- Need bounded frame sizes, connection slots and packet queues.

## When Not To Use

- Do not put peer discovery or relay policy here; that is `forge_net_p2p`.
- Do not put application protocol messages here; use framed streams as substrate.
- Do not disable peer verification outside explicit tests.

## Client Address Tokens

QUIC Retry tokens are valid for 10 seconds. A verified server issues one opaque
Forge regular `NEW_TOKEN` with a 60 minute validity period; connector-owned
client caches retain one unused token per canonical remote for 55 minutes.
The next connection consumes that token once before its Initial is created.

`client_options::client_tokens` is Preview. When absent, `connector` uses its
own bounded cache. An engaged value with both callbacks empty explicitly
disables caching; an engaged value must otherwise provide both `take` and
`store`. Callbacks are synchronous, nonblocking and may be invoked
concurrently, so custom stores must be thread-safe. A received `NEW_TOKEN` is
only stored after ALPN and configured peer verification succeed; callback
errors or a cache refusal never fail the connection.

An invalid, expired or foreign regular token is treated as unvalidated and
receives Retry. A Retry2 token that decrypts but fails address, expiry or
connection-ID verification is rejected with `INVALID_TOKEN`; unreadable Retry2
and failed legacy Retry tokens receive a fresh Retry.

## Examples

### Parse Endpoint

```cpp
import forge.net.quic.endpoint;

auto endpoint = forge::net::quic::parse_endpoint("127.0.0.1:9443");
auto authority = endpoint.authority();
```

### Connect With Expected Peer

```cpp
#include <boost/asio/awaitable.hpp>

import forge.net.quic.connector;
import forge.net.quic.options;
import forge.net.quic.security;

boost::asio::awaitable<void> connect_with_pin(
   forge::net::quic::connector& connector,
   forge::net::quic::endpoint endpoint) {
   auto options = forge::net::quic::client_options{
      .certificate_pem = client_certificate_pem,
      .private_key_pem = client_private_key_pem,
   };
   options.security.expected_sha256_fingerprint = expected_server_fingerprint;

   forge::net::quic::connection connection = co_await connector.async_connect(endpoint, options);
   use_connection(std::move(connection));
}
```

For CA-based verification, trust is explicit and host-bound:

```cpp
boost::asio::awaitable<void> connect_with_ca(
   forge::net::quic::connector& connector,
   forge::net::quic::endpoint endpoint) {
   auto options = forge::net::quic::client_options{};
   options.security = forge::net::quic::security_options{
      .verify_peer = true,
      .trusted_ca_pem = trusted_ca_bundle_pem,
   };

   // The certificate must be valid for endpoint.host through DNS/IP SAN matching.
   forge::net::quic::connection connection = co_await connector.async_connect(endpoint, options);
   use_connection(std::move(connection));
}
```

### Accept Connections

```cpp
#include <boost/asio/awaitable.hpp>

import forge.net.quic.listener;

boost::asio::awaitable<void> accept_one(forge::asio::runtime& runtime) {
   auto server_options = forge::net::quic::server_options{
      .certificate_pem = server_certificate_pem,
      .private_key_pem = server_private_key_pem,
   };

   auto listener = forge::net::quic::listener{
      runtime,
      forge::net::quic::parse_endpoint("127.0.0.1:9443"),
      server_options,
   };

   forge::net::quic::connection inbound = co_await listener.async_accept();
   handle_inbound(std::move(inbound));
}
```

### Open A Framed Stream

```cpp
#include <boost/asio/awaitable.hpp>

import forge.net.quic.framed_stream;

boost::asio::awaitable<void> write_payload(forge::net::quic::connection& connection) {
   forge::net::quic::stream stream = co_await connection.async_open_stream();
   auto framed = forge::net::quic::framed_stream{std::move(stream), {.max_frame_size = 1 << 20}};
   co_await framed.async_write_frame(payload);
}
```

### Bind API Frames To QUIC Streams

`forge.api.quic.binding` is the API-over-QUIC adapter. It keeps QUIC transport policy in
`forge_net_quic`, contract/error semantics in `forge_api_core`, and delegates frame-loop
mechanics to `forge.api.stream`.

```cpp
import forge.api.core.exceptions;
import forge.api.core.types;
import forge.api.core.descriptor;
import forge.api.core.error_projection;
import forge.api.core.handle;
import forge.api.core.connection;
import forge.api.core.registry;
import forge.api.core.binding;
import forge.api.core.dispatcher;
import forge.api.quic.binding;

auto plan = forge::api::core::binding()
   .serve(app.apis())
   .export_api<cache>({.id = {"cache"}, .major = 1, .min_revision = 8})
   .build();

auto binding = forge::api::quic::api()
   .use(plan)
   .codec({"forge.raw"})
   .max_concurrent_calls(256)
   .deadline(std::chrono::seconds{5})
   .build();

boost::asio::awaitable<void> serve_api_stream(forge::net::quic::connection& connection) {
   auto stream = co_await connection.async_accept_stream();
   co_await binding.accept(std::move(stream));
}
```

`forge.api.quic.binding` does not own certificates, ALPN, listener/connector setup or
packet-level limits. Those remain in `forge_net_quic` transport options. It also does
not own the generic API frame state machine; that lives in `forge.api.stream`.

### Decode Frames Without A Connection

```cpp
import forge.net.quic.framed_stream;

auto encoded = forge::net::quic::encode_frame(payload);
auto decoded = forge::net::quic::decode_frame(encoded);
if (decoded.status == forge::net::quic::frame_decode_status::complete) {
   consume(decoded.payload);
}
```

### Verify A Certificate Fingerprint

```cpp
import forge.net.quic.security;

auto fingerprint = forge::net::quic::certificate_sha256_fingerprint_from_pem(certificate_pem);
auto normalized = forge::net::quic::normalize_sha256_fingerprint(fingerprint);
```

## Backpressure And Failure Model

Transport limits cover stream count, queued bytes and inbound packet queue size.
Timeouts are scoped to handshake/connect/read/write phases so callers can return
typed failures instead of vague network errors.

Graceful connection close serializes and sends a standard QUIC application
`CONNECTION_CLOSE` before local transport teardown. Peers therefore observe a
terminal close promptly rather than retaining higher-level session ownership
until the QUIC idle timeout. Local failure paths may still terminate transport
immediately when a close frame cannot be emitted safely. Late packets for a
released connection are isolated according to ngtcp2's silent-drop contract;
they neither consume a listener slot indefinitely nor fail a concurrent
`async_accept()` for another connection.

## Initial Tokens

The listener validates the remote address with an encrypted QUIC Retry token
before allocating server connection or TLS state. Tokens are bound to the
remote endpoint, Retry connection ID and original destination connection ID,
and expire after the ngtcp2 donor-compatible ten-second validation window.

An empty, unknown, proprietary, or invalid `NEW_TOKEN` is unvalidated and
receives a fresh Retry. A Retry2 (`B7`) token that is readable but fails
address, expiry or connection-ID verification receives a stateless
`CONNECTION_CLOSE` with `INVALID_TOKEN`. Unreadable Retry2 tokens and failed
legacy (`B6`) tokens receive a fresh Retry because the legacy verifier cannot
distinguish foreign ciphertext from a readable invalid token. Valid Retry and
`NEW_TOKEN` tokens are passed to ngtcp2 with their respective token types
without poisoning a concurrent `async_accept()`.

`connection_metrics::new_tokens_submitted` counts frames accepted by ngtcp2
for transmission. It does not claim UDP delivery or client receipt.

`server_options::inbound_admission` is an optional early-admission hook for
higher-level resource managers. QUIC invokes it only after initial-token
validation but before allocating the server connection and TLS state. Returning
an empty token, or throwing, rejects that connection attempt; a non-empty token is held
until the connection closes or a higher-level transport adapter takes
ownership through the private connection-access bridge. Leaving the callback
empty keeps the standalone QUIC listener unrestricted by an external admission
layer.

## Security Notes

OpenSSL 3.0+ is the supported TLS backend. Fingerprint and mTLS failures are
correctness failures, not warnings. CA-based client verification binds the peer
certificate to the requested endpoint host; SNI alone is not treated as identity
verification. Pinned fingerprints and custom verifiers are explicit trust paths;
they do not implicitly opt into CA hostname checks. Test certificates must not
become application defaults.

## Risks And Anti-Patterns

- Do not disable peer verification to work around certificate issues. Fix trust
  material or use an explicit pinned/custom verifier path.
- Do not confuse SNI with identity verification. CA-based verification must bind
  the certificate to the requested endpoint host.
- Do not raise frame/queue limits without backpressure tests. Oversized frames
  are a memory pressure and denial-of-service vector.
- Do not define application API envelopes in QUIC handlers. Use `forge.api.quic.binding` and
  `forge::api::core::frame` for typed API calls over QUIC streams.
- Do not swallow handler exceptions in detached stream tasks; convert expected
  failures into typed `forge_exceptions` values or API error frames.
- Do not treat `.deadline(...)` or `.max_concurrent_calls(...)` as documentation
  only; API frames are checked by the call runtime before application handlers run.
- Do not put ALPN, certificate or listener lifecycle options into
  `forge.api.quic.binding`; those belong to the transport owner.

## Typical Mistakes

- Do not put peer discovery or relay fallback in `forge_net_quic`; use `forge_net_p2p`.
- Do not use insecure test settings as application defaults; identity and ALPN
  checks are part of correctness.
- Do not bypass `transport_limits` for "temporary" large frames without adding a
  backpressure test.

## Tests

`test_forge_quic_p2p` covers endpoint parsing, frame codec, loopback handshakes,
parallel streams, loss/delay/reorder fault proxy, mTLS, pinned fingerprints and
backpressure limits.
