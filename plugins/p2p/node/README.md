# P2P Node Plugin

`forge::plugins::p2p::node` owns one shared `forge_net_p2p` node and exposes typed
contribution APIs for protocol handlers and API-over-P2P publication.

## Current Support State

The plugin provides the Stage 5 persistence and topology configuration surface:
identity material is loaded through Crypto Secrets, peer/Rendezvous state and
per-profile DHT values/providers are persisted through separate adapters in
one dedicated DB Store Object layer, and hydration completes before listeners
open. The low-level node owns bootstrap, automatic Identify/Identify Push,
scoped network resources, multi-profile Kademlia routing, durable records and
provider maintenance. It also owns the managed/static mode selection,
watermarks and explicit Rendezvous/Forge Peer Exchange source configuration;
all timers, queries, dials and pruning remain owned by the low-level node. The
plugin does not contain a second network maintenance loop.

Insecure memory mode remains an explicit local-test path only. Current support
classifications live
in
[`p2p_feature_inventory.json`](../../../tests/libp2p_interop/p2p_feature_inventory.json);
isolated codec and interop fixtures do not promote this plugin to production.

## When To Use

- A Forge application needs one shared P2P node managed by `forge_app`.
- Product plugins need to publish protocol handlers or typed APIs over the same
  peer/session substrate.
- Diagnostics, resolver and pubsub plugins should compose over one node instead
  of creating parallel network stacks.

## When Not To Use

- Do not create product routing, durable queue or authorization policy in this
  plugin.
- Do not instantiate raw `forge::net::p2p::node` separately inside application
  plugins.
- Do not enable insecure test mode outside local tests.

## Identity

- Target: `forge_plugins_p2p_node`
- Package component: `plugins_p2p_node`

## What It Provides Today

- Starts and stops a shared P2P node through the `forge_app` lifecycle.
- Acquires the configured physical store and registers private P2P-state
  ObjectDB models during `after_initialize()`.
- Loads certificate/private-key secrets, validates or explicitly resets the
  private cache schema, opens ObjectDB persistence and performs bounded
  hydration during `startup()` before opening any listener.
- Maps config into listen/bootstrap/advertised endpoints and relay/path policy.
- Maps topology watermarks, configured Rendezvous points/namespaces and Forge
  Peer Exchange policy into the node-owned topology manager.
- Passes bootstrap policy to the node, which owns bounded startup, reconnect
  backoff and connection-manager protection.
- Lets application plugins publish typed APIs over a P2P protocol id.
- Opens typed remote API handles to peers through `remote<Interface>()`.
- Provides internal source APIs used by focused diagnostics and pubsub plugins.

`request_stop()` synchronously closes managed-topology, Forge Peer Exchange and
new-session admission, then requests cancellation of bootstrap and maintenance
work. It intentionally does not tear down established sessions. `shutdown()` is
the completion barrier: it awaits topology workers, including best-effort
Rendezvous unregister, then tears down sessions and flushes/closes peer state
before releasing DB and Secrets handles. Application lifecycle code calls
`request_stop()` to initiate shutdown and awaits `shutdown()` for cleanup.
If peer-state close fails, the stopped node and its persistence ownership are
retained so a subsequent `shutdown()` can retry deterministic close; the plugin
never drops a persistence backend that still reports pending close work.
An empty active session set is not treated as proof that STCP/Yamux cleanup has
completed.

The plugin does not implement product routing policy or durable application
queues. Core libp2p-style mechanics belong to `forge_net_p2p`; this plugin composes
that substrate for applications.

Including `/p2p/<peer-id>` in each bootstrap endpoint pins the expected
authenticated peer and is recommended for production. Existing peer-less
bootstrap endpoints remain supported; their peer is learned only after the
authenticated connection succeeds.

The named DB Store must provide an Object layer dedicated to P2P peer and DHT
record state.
One authoritative schema marker versions the complete private row family, so
startup validates the format without scanning durable history. A missing marker
in nonempty storage or a version mismatch fails startup. With
`schema-policy: reset`, the v2 recovery path atomically removes the complete private P2P row
family, including peer, Rendezvous, DHT value/provider and sequence records.
Normal node startup hydrates peer candidates from configured bootstrap peers;
it does not recover DHT values, local provider ownership or Rendezvous
registrations. Products must publish or register those records again.
Secret policies must allow
`p2p.identity.certificate` and `p2p.identity.private-key` respectively.
`allow-insecure-test-mode` is for local tests only. Programmatic low-level node
construction may still provide identity material directly.

Plugin 2.0 removes inline certificate and private-key PEM configuration. Migrate
each value into Crypto Secrets and replace it with `certificate-secret` or
`private-key-secret`. This is an intentional plugin configuration break; the
low-level `forge_net_p2p` identity options remain source-compatible.

Plugin 3.0 replaces the single DHT capability/configuration surface with
explicit `dht.profiles` and adds `peer-store.schema-policy` for the recoverable
private cache. The local plugin API contract remains `1.0`; only Preview
configuration and low-level DHT source contracts change.

Plugin 4.0 adds the managed topology configuration shown above. Rendezvous
client activity is limited to explicitly configured points and namespaces;
Forge Peer Exchange is a Forge extension and is queried only on identified
peers that advertise its exact protocol. Set `topology.mode: static-only` to
disable autonomous discovery, dialing and pruning. The local plugin API
contract remains `1.0`.

### Publish A Typed API

```cpp
import forge.api.core.binding;
import forge.plugins.p2p.node.api;
import forge.plugins.p2p.node.plugin;

class catalog_p2p_plugin final : public forge::app::plugin {
 public:
   boost::asio::awaitable<void> initialize(forge::app::plugin_context& context) override {
      auto p2p = context.apis().get<forge::plugins::p2p::node::api>(
         {.id = {"forge.plugins.p2p.node"}, .major = 1});

      auto plan = forge::api::core::binding()
         .serve(context.apis())
         .export_api<catalog_api>()
         .build();

      p2p->publish_api(std::move(plan), forge::net::p2p::protocol_id{.value = "/catalog/api/1"});
      co_return;
   }
};
```

```cpp
registry.register_plugin(forge::plugins::db::store::descriptor());
registry.register_plugin(forge::plugins::crypto::secrets::descriptor());
registry.register_plugin(forge::plugins::p2p::node::descriptor());
```

## Security And Boundaries

- The plugin owns network lifecycle and contribution mounting, not product
  authorization decisions.
- Peer identity, protocol negotiation and session mechanics stay in
  `forge_net_p2p`; application plugins use typed contribution APIs.
- Insecure test mode and generated identity material are local-test-only.
- Durable peer history supplies startup candidates, not trusted live routes;
  Kademlia server admission still requires verified Identify or a successful
  DHT exchange.

## Common Mistakes

- Creating a second node in a product plugin instead of requesting the shared
  node API.
- Treating P2P reachability as authorization.
- Publishing unbounded handlers without deadline/frame limits.
